# Hacktoberfest18

<a href="hactoberfest.digitalocean.com">Hacktoberfest</a> is an initiative by GitHub and Digital Ocean to get more people involved in Open Source. This year, even Twilio has joined hands with them.<br>

Hacktoberfest runs throughout the month of October and every individual with 5 or more PRs made (not necessary to be accepted and merged) gets stickers and a limited edition hacktoberfest t-shirt.<br>

It's a great way to start off your journey into open source.<br>

For starters, we'll be creating a file called <a href="">membership.md</a>. Add your name, batch, email_id and github_id to that.<br>
